# Chat-app using Node.Js, Express and Socket.IO

Use Node.JS WebSocket protocol instead of a request-response architecture with Socket.IO to handle users connecting to the chat application, along with the messages they send and receive.

## Requirements

Shoutout to [Codedex.io](https://www.codedex.io/) for their amazing tutorial on this one! âœŒ

## Setup ðŸ’»

Open a new terminal to install all of the dependencies project running:

```bash

npm install 

```

In order to test the app run:
 
```bash

npm run serve

```

## Goal of this project? ðŸ’¡

* Understand What the WebSocket protocol is, and how it differs from a request-response architecture.

* How to use Socket.IO to handle users connecting to the chat application,  along with the messages they send and receive.

* Improve my Node.Js skills using async/wait, promises and Express.Js

## Under Construction featuresðŸš§

I'm currently building a database with MongoDB to scalate the project in order to store all of the messages instead of using a chat history array on every session. 

Also, I'll improve the front-end UI with Next.JS
